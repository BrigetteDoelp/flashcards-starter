# FlashCards Solo Project

##### Description:

This application allows you to play a game of flashcards in your terminal.

##### Usage:

Clone down this repo. In your terminal, move into the directory for this game. From there type out or copy this phrase; `node index,js`. This should start the game.

##### Timeline:

We were given four days for this project. I asked for an extension for personal reasons, and was given an extra three days to complete it. 

##### Resources: 

I used past knowledge and notes to logic out this project. If I was stuck, I first googled for answers, then reached out to peers and/or mentors if I could find no solution on my own.

##### Final Project Outcome:

The game is fully playable in the command line. Using the dataset provided, you can play through all of the cards, and be given a percentage correct at the end of the game.
